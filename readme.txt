Whether you use WordPress for your business or even just as blog or hobby site, one thing remains true, getting people to opt in to your mailing list or newsletter is essential.

Using popup windows was once frowned on as a ploy used by marketers who were just out to grab your cash, but it has entered the mainstream, with large scale and legitimate business and website owners using popups to gather email addresses, ask for social network shares such as Facebook likes, or to promote the latest and greatest product/service.

= Delayed Pop-Ups =

Not all popups are necessary as soon as a page loads. Consider a delayed pop-up for your site. There are a variety of options for this, including pop ups that only show on scroll, on click, or after a certain amount of time on the WordPress site.

= Subscription popup = 

Popup email forms have huge potential when it comes to list building, and even if you hate them, there's no doubt that they work. Professional bloggers unanimously agree that they increase subscription rates, and have had great success with them.
