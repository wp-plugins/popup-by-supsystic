Whether you use WordPress for your business or even just as blog or hobby site, one thing remains true, getting people to opt in to your mailing list or newsletter is essential.

Using popup windows was once frowned on as a ploy used by marketers who were just out to grab your cash, but it has entered the mainstream, with large scale and legitimate business and website owners using popups to gather email addresses, ask for social network shares such as Facebook likes, or to promote the latest and greatest product/service.

= Delayed Pop-Ups =

Not all popups are necessary as soon as a page loads. Consider a delayed pop-up for your site. There are a variety of options for this, including pop ups that only show on scroll, on click, or after a certain amount of time on the WordPress site.

= Subscription Popup = 

Popup email forms have huge potential when it comes to list building, and even if you hate them, there's no doubt that they work. Professional bloggers unanimously agree that they increase subscription rates, and have had great success with them.

= Do YOU Need PopUp or Optin? =

Popups work… really, really, really well. I’ve yet to see a case study where optin popups decreased the site’s conversion rate, and I’ve seen countless case studies where popups catapulted CRO by as high as 250 - 400%.

Popup can collect emails and you can adjust where it displays on your website, as well as how often it displays. Fully customizable popup optin, with access to numerous templates and data collection options.

Many of your site’s visitors may never land on your pages again. You have one chance to convert them into a lead or capture them as part of your regular audience with popup.

Popups allow you to stick a CTA front and center, demanding an action. If readers liked your content, they will be much more likely to give you their email when asked then to search your site for a sidebar popup social subscription box. 

== Installation ==

= First Time Popup Supsystic user =

Thank you for choosing  Popup Supsystic! Open page of our plug-in admin panel WordPress and you will see two menu items: "Add New", "All Pop-Ups". 

In order to create your popup, simply click on "Add New" in your left menu. Choose pop-up template (you can change it later), then set the name of pop-up and click OK. Once the Popup Supsystic page loads, set the options for your pop-up. Here you can set when to show popup, whom to show, on what pages to show, add your content for popup. It is already possible to set your own design and choose the animation for pop-up, enable subscription and social buttons. Also you have the ability to edit the popup using the css and html code. 
Don't forget to press the "Save" button. After all these points you can see the result on the bottom of the page.
